# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation
- `/src`: Main source code that OpenAI Codex should analyze
  - `/adaptor`: Acts as a wrapper module that imports utility and API methods from the `@hotwax/oms-api` package and re-exports them for centralized access throughout the app.
  - `/assets`: Project images and static resources.
  - `/authorization`: Uses the `@casl/ability` package to implement the authorization layer.
    - `Rules.ts`: Contains rules in key-value pair format. The right side maps to backend OMS permissions; the left side uses a rule format prefixed with `APP_`.
    - `Actions.ts`: Defines actions. Keys and values match those used in rules.
  - `/components`: Reusable Ionic Vue components such as modals, filters, popovers, and alerts.
  - `/event-bus`: Event emitter utility using the `mitt` package.
  - `/locales`: Contains internationalization (i18n) support files.
    - `en.json`: English labels.
    - `es.json`: Spanish labels.
    - `ja.json`: Japanese labels.
  - `/logger`: Custom logging component. Use `logger` methods instead of `console.log`.
  - `/router`: Vue router for Ionic navigation.
  - `/services`: Contains API services, modularized by domain (e.g., `CarrierService`, `OrderService`, `ProductService`, etc.).
  - `/store`: Vuex store, structured for modular state management.
  - `/theme`: Global styling definitions (e.g., `theme/variable.css`).
  - `/utils`: Utility/helper functions. OpenAI Codex can add to existing files or create new ones as needed.
  - `/views`: Vue page components using Ionic.
- `/public`: Static assets (OpenAI Codex should not modify these directly)

## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation
- Use ionic/vue components for the UI.
- Use dxp-components and oms-api wherever needed.
- Use/Add Util functions for reusable code.
- Use Vue JS Options API.
- Always remove unused ionic components.
- Always import ionic component and define them using defineComponent.
- Always use mapGetters for accessing computed data
- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output
- OpenAI Codex should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

### @hotwax/dxp-components package usage Conventions for Agents.md Implementation
- Look for all the functionality available in @hotwax/dxp-components package and use them. Look for existing references for the same.
    
### @hotwax/oms-api package usage Conventions for Agents.md Implementation
- Look for all the functionality available in @hotwax/oms-api package and use them. Look for existing references for the same. This package contains APIs that can be used via adaptor
